/**
 * MSW request handlers for the web app.
 *
 * This file is intentionally minimal and exports an empty handler list.
 * Add handlers here as you start writing tests that need to mock network
 * requests, for example:
 *
 *   import { rest } from "msw";
 *
 *   export const handlers = [
 *     rest.get("/api/health", (_req, res, ctx) =>
 *       res(ctx.status(200), ctx.json({ ok: true }))
 *     ),
 *   ];
 */

export const handlers: any[] = [];
